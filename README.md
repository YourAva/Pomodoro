# Pomodoro üçÖ
A while back, I found out about something called the **Pomodoro Technique**. This is a study technique that is believed to maximise efficiency by allowing someone to keep as much attention as possible into one subject.
## What is this project?
This project aims to guide someone through this study strategy, infinitely looping in a list of the 25 minute break and 5 minute break (x4) and then a much larger 20 minute break. I'm very aware that this type of project has been done before and to a much more visually appealing standpoint. However I wanted to challlenge myself with a fun C project.
## Final Notes
As always with my projects, if you have any notes feel free to message me on Discord, my username is ``@AvaLikesBread``, I look forward to hearing feedback.
